- check tokens 

`invites update` renamed to `invites resend`
The CLI had a command to "update" an invite which took an email address. However this request parameter was never honored, and internally the API was called "resend-invite." This was renamed to make that clearer.

`invites get` did not exist on the backend and was removed.

`projects get` appeared to look for 404s and print out `project does not exist` if it got one, but I couldn't make this work and in practice printing the error response from the server is OK

`mesdb clusters update` was broken as it sent the wrong request body.

## TODO

[ ] check that the `access` `tokens` commands work identically
[ ] peering create is complicated because if it fails it woould call `DerivePeerignCommands` (which everywhere else is called `CreatePeeringCommands`- should it be changed?) and then print out some stuff. But it should probably check for a specific error code and also message ot the user what is happening, so if it fails when creating the peering commands the error message isn't a mystery.
[ ] `node_index` needs to be added to Mesdb Create cluster
